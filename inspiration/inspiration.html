        <h1>My name is Navin Sroeurn</h1>

            <h2>These are some of popele who inspire me in design and my life</h2>
                <a href="https://www.lisamam.com/"><h3><em>Lisa Mam</em></h3></a>

                <p>She is a Cambodian designer who has a unique style that is both modern and traditional.
                   She is a great example of how to blend the old with the new. Lisa is an inspiration for 
                   me to be in design major because one day I love to see my design collaborate with big companies 
                   such as Adidas as she did. I want to share my culture thru degning to the world and let people 
                   who Know Cambodia is an amazing place that they should go and see.</p>

                <p>He is a Cambodian rapper who inspires my life alot. One of his songs called <strong>Night Thinker</strong> 
                    always reminds me that I have my parent who always support me no matter what happens to me Most of his songs inspire
                    me every day to not give up on myself and everybody around me.There was a time when I was so down because I failed so
                     many classes, and I thought about dropping out of school. Listening to that song reminds me that my parents always support 
                     me no matter what happens, so I need to keep going for myself and my parents There I am today still keeping going and becoming 
                     better as a student in SFSU.</p>
                
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cristiano/"><h3><em>Christiano Ronaldo</em></h3></a>
                <br>
                <img src="img/CR7.jpg.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This one might not in the topic of artist but he is the one that I love the most, Christiano Ronaldo. He is an inspiring figure! His dedication, 
                    work ethic, and longevity in football are remarkable. He has consistently proven himself as one of the greatest players of all time, 
                    with numerous records and achievements to his name. What inspires me about him is his incredible goal-scoring ability, his resilience, 
                    and perhaps his journey from a kid living in a small town to becoming a global icon. The fact that he is 40 years old and playing and 
                    scoring like a young man is so incredible to me.
