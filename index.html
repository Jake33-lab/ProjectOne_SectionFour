        <h1>My name is Navin Sroeurn</h1>

        <img src="img/Navin.jpg">

        <p>I am Navin Sroeurn, a San Francisco State University student majoring in Visual Communication Design. Originally I am from Cambodia.
            I came to the United States in November 2017. A fun fact about me is that I love to play video games. No matter if it is a mobile 
            game or pc game or console game, I play them all. The reason I play videos so much is that since I have lived in the United States
            I have had no friends to hang out with, so I spend all my free time staying home playing video games. English is my second language, 
            it is always a pressure and challenge for me to communicate with other people. I normally spend my time alone in school. Another thing
            about me is that I love football. Back in Cambodia, I used to play football every day with my friends after class. Since I moved to The 
            United States, I have lost interest in football and started to enjoy volleyball instead. It was sad that I could not play volleyball during
            my last year of high school. After practicing for a week and being ready to compete in the school league, COVID-19 hit and every school was 
            closed and changed to remote. I consider that was the saddest high school graduation year for me.
